# Checked A simple todo list app

## About

Checked is a minimal todo list app. It keeps tracks of your todos. I used html, css and javascript to create this project. It was a bit challenging to find out the best data flow, this is also something I want to improve with future iterations as well as implementing a more functional programing paradigm. I would also like to try to implement the same app as a React or Svelt application since it would make rendering the apps ui a lot easier.

## Take a look
