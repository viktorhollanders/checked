## About

Checked is a minimal to-do list app. I wanted to get to know basic web technologies, and to-do list applications are a great way to understand how a programming language works since you have to implement CRUD operations. It also allowed me to experiment with some design ideas. The project is built using basic web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
